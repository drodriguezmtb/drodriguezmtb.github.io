        <h2 class="animated fadeIn delay-1s">My role</h2>
        <p class="animated fadeInRight">
          It was the first app project that I faced from start to end in both iOS and Android.
          I had to be in close collaboration with devs cause the project required to be fast
          It was a ->'little'<- project but very important cause it was for an international event and had to be done in a couple of weeks.
        </p>

        <hr class="animated fadeIn delay-1s">
        <h2 class="animated fadeIn delay-1s">What I learned</h2>
        <p class="animated fadeInLeft">
          I am proud of this project because it was my first mobile app.
          Despite it was a small project it means to me the first interaction with
          a couple of new things like iOS & Android guidelines, designing in sprints with agile,
          working closely with developers and how this collaboration becomes rapidly into a real product.
