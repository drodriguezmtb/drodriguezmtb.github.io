        <h2 class="animated fadeIn delay-1s">Overview</h2>
        <p class="animated fadeInLeft">
          Our goal was to create an easy way for 'Itaca' customers to pay their
          beers through their mobiles (Apple Pay did not exist yet).
          In order to create engagement the customers earn points for each
          payment and this lets them upgrade their 'status' and get special offers.

        <h2 class="animated fadeIn delay-1s">My role</h2>
        <p class="animated fadeInRight">
          As a UI Designer I was defining a basic architecture and the styling of
          the app based in an existing styleguide, guided by a senior designer.
          We applied native components to be faster.
        </p>

        <hr class="animated fadeIn delay-1s">
        <h2 class="animated fadeIn delay-1s">What I learned</h2>
        <p class="animated fadeInLeft">
          I am proud of this project because it was my first mobile app.
          Despite it was a small project it means to me the first interaction with
          a couple of new things like iOS & Android guidelines, designing in sprints with agile,
          working closely with developers and how this collaboration becomes rapidly into a real product.
